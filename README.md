# 05-Space-Shooter
Space shooter project for game design class.

I attempted to get the character to run towards the right end of the screen to create more of a game scenario, but couldn't figure out how to move the sprite automatically. I used the principles from the bullet and animation exercices to create a spaceship simulation shooter triggered on mouse press. 

# PEER REVIEW QUESTIONS

Project: Space Hooter Peer Review
Peer's repository: 
https://github.com/tylermargetts/05-Space-Shooter


# What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

It was interesting to see an added background image into the code, whereas I only used a single color background.

# What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

I would enjoy adding a different background to mine, as well as attempting to make the enemy sprites have multiple animations associated with them as was attempted in my peers project.

# What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

I would suggest using I different method for controlling the player sprite, as well as making it to where the player could collide with the enemy to die. I would also suggest adding an end gem condition do the player user knows when the game is over, rather than the window just closing once all the enemies where destroyed. I would also suggest using sprites that don't have colored boxes around them, this would enhance the visual aspects of the interesting objects in the window.

# What could have been clearer or better commented?

Not to many comments throughout the main.py file, potentially could add more comments in general throughout.

# Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

Nothing I was confused by 

# Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

Yes it does 

# What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

Could have had something about how to win/ finish the game, so that when the window closed upon all enemies defeated the user would be aware of what was actually happening

# Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

I enjoyed the simplisity and concise nature of the code. It was easy to read, and the the game executed correctly.
